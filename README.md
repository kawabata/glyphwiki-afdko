GlyphWiki AFDKO Font Generator
==============================

## Overview

This is a tool to produce the fonts from
[GlyphWiki](http://glyphwiki.org), the wiki site that anyone can post
any glyph.

## HanaMin Font (AFDKO version)
The product font of this toolthat covers all Unicode Ideographs are
prepared in the
separated [github repository](https://github.com/cjkvi/HanaMinAFDKO/).

## Description

This tool creates OpenType GSUB/GPOS featured font from
[Kage](http://fonts.jp/kage/) data of GlyphWiki.

Following procedures are taken to create fonts from GlyphWiki.

1. Download newest dump data from GlyphWiki web site.
2. Extract and expand Kage Data of needed glyphs.
3. Convert Kage data to SVG image files by [Kage Engine](http://git.chise.org/gitweb/?p=chise/kage.git;a=summary).
4. Clip the outlines of SVG images by using
   [Clipper](http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyclipping/), then
   convert it to SVG Font.
5. Convert SVG Font to PostScript Type1 name-keyed font by
   [AFDKO](http://www.adobe.com/jp/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) tx.
6. Dump name-keys of created font and create CID index.
7. Create CMAP (including IVS) and GSUB/GPOS features based on dump data.
8. Create CID-keyed font by using AFDKO mergeFonts.
9. Create OpenType font from CID-Keyed font by using AFDKO mkotf.

## Requirements

You need [AFDKO](http://www.adobe.com/jp/devnet/opentype/afdko.html)
[Github Version](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko),
[Adobe Perl Scripts](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/perl-scripts),
[Emacs](www.gnu.org/software/emacs) (25.2 or later),
[Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Rhino), perl, wget,
[Math::Clipper](http://search.cpan.org/~smueller/Math-Clipper/lib/Math/Clipper.pm),
basic Unix tools, 10Gbyte of disk space and the Internet connection.

## Usage

By default, eight fonts will be generated.

- HanaMinA.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho A)
  This font mainly covers CJKV Ideographs of BMP (Basic Mulitilingual Plane).

- HanaMinB.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho B)
  This font mainly covers CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B.

- HanaMinC.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho C)
  This font mainly covers CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C to F.

- HanaMinAX.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho AX)
  This font mainly covers CJKV Ideographs of Extension A.

- HanaMinUX.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho AX)
  This font mainly covers CJKV Ideographs URO (Unified Repertoire Ordering).

- HanaMinBX.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho BX)
  This font mainly covers CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B.

- HanaMinCX.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho CX)
  This font mainly covers CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C to F.

- HanaMinI.otf (Font Family Name: Hanazono Mincho I)
  This font mainly covers IDS (Ideographic Description Sequences).

These fonts also cover all variants of
[IVD](http://www.unicode.org/ivd/) collections.

## Installation

Run the following command to create the newest font. Please make sure
that you install all required software, set up Perl library environment
variables, set the $(SCRIPTS) variable to the installation
directory of AFDKO perl scripts.

    git clone http://github.com/kawabata/glyphwiki-afdko
    cd glyphwiki-afdko
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    «check Makefile/Makefile_HanaMin settings»
    make

You can also build in a Docker container to make it easier to install
the dependencies like this:

    git clone http://github.com/kawabata/glyphwiki-afdko
    cd glyphwiki-afdko
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    docker build -t gw-afdko .
    docker run -v "$PWD:/code" -w /code gw-afdko make

This will download "dump.tar.gz" from GlyphWiki web site and create
the fonts. It may take several hours (depends on your machine power),
and then "HanaMinA.otf" and "HanaMinB.otf" will be produced.

You can check the contents of produced fonts by AFDKO spot tools, e.g.

    spot -Proof HanaMinA.pdf > HanaMinA.ps
    ps2pdf HanaMinA.ps -o HanaMinA.pdf

Note that "spec" is a regular expression to match for GlyphWiki name.
Pre-built font can be downloaded from
[HanaMinAFDKO Releases](https://github.com/cjkvi/HanaMinAFDKO/releases)
page.

## Troubleshooting

When make command fails, there may be some empty files, which you
should remove to avoid unexpected error.

    find . -type f -empty -delete

Be sure that Math::Cliper is properly installed. It is confirmed to
work with Macintosh and Linux.  However, if you are using MacOS 10.9.1
or later, installation of Math::Clipper via CPAN may fail. In that
case, install perl 5.18 (from Homebrew, etc.) and try again.
